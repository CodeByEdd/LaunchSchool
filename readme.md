# Launch School

Launch School is an online coding boot camp which focuses on building web applications with Ruby on Rails. 

I will upload all scrpits and projects from this bootcamp into this repository. This is my first time using Ruby so it will no doubt start with many trivial programs, hopefully this will quickly develop into entire web apps.
